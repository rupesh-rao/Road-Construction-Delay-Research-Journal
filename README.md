# Road-Construction-Delay-Research-Journal

It is a research journal which I wrote as a test for getting an Internship under Blackcoffer. In this project I was given a data consisting of the attributes or factors that are responsible for delay in road projects in UAE. I have ranked the factors that are majorly responsible for the delay. Also, I have compared the cost overrun possibilities in different states/emirates (e.g. Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah).
